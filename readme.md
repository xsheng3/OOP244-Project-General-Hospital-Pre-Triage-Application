Because of the pandemic and prevention of the spread of COVID19, hospitals need to screen the patients and separate those in need of COVID-test from others. This has to be done in an orderly fashion by letting the patients know what is the expected wait time and let them know when they can be admitted to prevent lineups. 

Your task is to help complete the implementation of the Pre-Triage application that does the above. 

## The Pre-Triage Application
The application starts by displaying a simple menu with three options:
```Text
General Hospital Pre-Triage Application
1- Register
2- Admit
0- Exit
>
```
### Register
The register option is selected to screen patients before getting into the hospital. The user can select between a COVID Test or Triage.

COVID test is selected if the patient is at the hospital for a COVID Test. In this case, the patient's name and OHIP number are entered and then a ticket will be printed with a call number and estimated time of admission for the patient.

If Triage is selected then in addition to the patient's name and OHIP number, the symptoms of the patient are entered. Then a ticket for Triage is printed with an estimated time of admission.

### Admit
Admit is selected when the COVID Test area or the Triage section is ready to accept a patient. After selecting COVID or Triage, the patient with the next ticket in line will be called. Based on the time of the call, the average wait time for the next patient for that lineup (COVID or Triage) will be updated.

## Milestones due dates
The project will be done in 4 or 5 milestones and each milestone will have its due date. The due date of each milestone will be announced when it is published, and it is based on the amount of work to be done for that milestone. 

## Final project mark

Only the last milestone of the project is evaluated and the other milestones are to make sure you are on track and not making any irreversible mistakes. 

Although the due dates for the milestones are not firm (it is ok to be a few days early or late) but regular submission of the milestones is mandatory and holds 25% of the final mark. For example, if you submit all your milestones one week before the final due date of the project you will lose the 25% mark. 

**Your project will receive a mark of zero if all the milestones are not submitted by the rejection date stated for the milestones**

You can check the due date of each milestone using the ```-due``` flag in the submission command:
```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/m? -due
```
- replace **2??** with the subject code
- replace **m?** with the milestone number

## Citation, Sources

When submitting your work, all the files submitted should carry full student information along with the "citation and sources" information. See the following example:

```

## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: the compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++11`: the code will be compiled using the C++11 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as following to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind ws
```

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.

> Note: All the code written in the project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace.

## Project Implementation notes:  *Very Important, read carefully*
-	All the code written in this project should be within the namespace sdds.
-	You are free and encouraged to add any member variables, functions and member functions you find necessary to complete your code. If you are not sure about your strategy for adding functionalities and properties to your classes, ask your professor for advice.  
-	A module called **utils** is added to the project with one function that can be used in your implementation. You can add any custom code of your own to the **utils** module to be used throughout the project. Also, because the application works with real system time, for debugging purposes a global **sdds::debug** flag is added to the utils module. (see utils and Time module for more information)<br/>
You could use this flag for your own debugging messages also.  **utils.h** will be included in all the unit tests of the milestones. 
> Note that all the debugging code and debugging comments must be removed before submission.

-	Unless you are asked for a specific definition, name the variables, and functions yourself. Use proper names and follow the naming conventions instructed by your professor. Having meaningless and misleading names will attract a penalty.

-	Throughout the project, if any class is capable of displaying or writing itself, the member function will always have the following signature: 
The function will return a reference of an **ostream** and will receive a reference of an "ostream" as an argument.  
-	Throughout the project, if any class is capable of reading or receiving its content from a stream, the member function will always have the following signature: 
The function will return a reference of an **istream** and will receive a reference on an **istream** as an argument.  
-	When creating methods (member functions) make sure to make them constant if in their logic, they are not modifying their class.
-	When passing an object or variable by address or reference, if they are not to be modified, make sure they are passed as constant pointers and references.
-	If an Empty state is required for an object, it is considered to be an “invalid” empty state, and objects in this state should be rendered unusable.

# Milestone 1 

## utils Module
### getInt()
Add the following functions to the utils module:
```C++
int getInt(
   const char* prompt = nullptr   // User entry prompt
);
```
This function performs a fool-proof integer entry from the console. 

If the prompt is not null, it is displayed before the entry as a prompt (only once).

If the user enters an invalid integer, the message ```"Bad integer value, try again: "``` is displayed until the user enters a valid integer value.

If after a valid integer value any character other than a **New Line** is entered, then the message ```"Enter only an integer, try again: "``` is displayed until the user enters only an integer value at the entry.

The entered value is returned at the end.

```C++
int getInt(
   int min,   // minimum acceptable value
   int max,   // maximum acceptable value
   const char* prompt = nullptr,  // User entry prompt
   const char* errorMessage = nullptr, // Invalid value error message
   bool showRangeAtError = true    // display the range if invalud value entered 
);
```
This function performs a fool-proof integer entry from the console. 

This function works exactly like the previous getInt function with the following additional features.

The range of the valid entry is checked after a valid integer is received.

If the value is out of the range specified by the **min** and **max** arguments, the function will keep trying to get a proper value until the user enters it correctly. 

After each invalid entry, the errorMessage is displayed only if the errorMessage is not null.

After each invalid entry, the range of valid entry is displayed in the following format only if the showRangeAtError argument is true:
```Text
"[MM <= value <= XX]"
```
- MM is replaced with the min argument value
- XX is replaced with the max argument value

### getInt unit test
```C++
void getIntTester() {
   cout << "getInt tester:" << endl;

   cout << "Enter 11: ";
   cout << getInt() << endl << endl;

   cout << "Enter the following values at the prompt: " << endl;
   cout << "abc<ENTER>" << endl;
   cout << "9abc<ENTER>" << endl;
   cout << "9 <ENTER> (there is a space after 9)" << endl;
   cout << "9<ENTER>" << endl;
   cout << getInt("> ") << endl << endl;

   cout << "Enter the following values at the prompt: " << endl;
   cout << "abc<ENTER>" << endl;
   cout << "9<ENTER>" << endl;
   cout << "10<ENTER>" << endl;
   cout << "21<ENTER>" << endl;
   cout << "21 <ENTER> (there is a space after 21)" << endl;
   cout << "20<ENTER>" << endl;
   getInt(10, 20, "> ", "Value must be between 10 and 20: ", false);
   cout << "last value entered: " << getInt(10, 20, "> ", "Invalid value, retry ") << endl;
}
```
#### getIntTester output
```Text
getInt tester:
Enter 11: 11
11

Enter the following values at the prompt:
abc<ENTER>
9abc<ENTER>
9 <ENTER> (there is a space after 9)
9<ENTER>
> abc
Bad integer value, try again: 9abc
Enter only an integer, try again: 9
Enter only an integer, try again: 9
9

Enter the following values at the prompt:
abc<ENTER>
9<ENTER>
10<ENTER>
21<ENTER>
21 <ENTER> (there is a space after 21)
20<ENTER>
> abc
Bad integer value, try again: 9
Value must be between 10 and 20: 10
> 21
Invalid value, retry [10 <= value <= 20]: 21
Enter only an integer, try again: 20
last value entered: 20

```
### getcstr()
```C++
char* getcstr(
   const char* prompt = nullptr,   // User entry prompt
   std::istream& istr = std::cin,  // the Stream to read from
   char delimiter = '\n'    // Delimiter to mark the end of data
);

```
Prompts the user for the entry if the prompt argument is not null. 

Receives an unknown size string from the istream object and allocates a dynamic Cstring to the size of the string and copies the value of the string into it. (Make sure null termination is put into account when setting the size)

In the end, it will return the dynamically allocated memory. 

> Optional Challenge: Implement this without using the C++ **string** class. (Make sure to notify your professor of the implementation in your final project reflection)

#### getcstr unit test

```C++
void getcstrTester() {
   char* cstr;
   cout << "Copy and past the following at the prompt:" << endl;
   cout << "If you didn't care what happened to me, "
      "And I didn't care for you, "
      "We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain, "
      "Occasionally glancing up through the rain. "
      "Wondering which of the brothers to blame. "
      "And watching for pigs on the wing." << endl;
   cstr = getcstr("Paste here /> ");
   cout << cstr << endl;
   delete[] cstr;
}
```
#### getcstrTester output
```Text
Copy and paste the following at the prompt:
If you didn't care what happened to me, And I didn't care for you, We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain, Occasionally glancing up through the rain. Wondering which of the brothers to blame. And watching for pigs on the wing.
Paste here /> If you didn't care what happened to me, And I didn't care for you, We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain, Occasionally glancing up through the rain. Wondering which of the brothers to blame. And watching for pigs on the wing.
you entered:
If you didn't care what happened to me, And I didn't care for you, We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain, Occasionally glancing up through the rain. Wondering which of the brothers to blame. And watching for pigs on the wing.
```

## Time Module
The time module is designed to:
- read and write time values.
- measure the passage of time by doing basic arithmetic operations

The time module only holds the time in minutes but will display and read the time in the following format:  

```Text
HH:MM
```
For example, when the Time object holds the value 125, it will display **02:05**. Likewise if the time **13:55** is read by the Time object from a stream, **835** is stored in the object (i.e. 13x60+55). Note that since the Time object is also used for the passage of time, there is no limit to the number of hours and minutes and they may pass 24 and 60  if needed.  
> Note: **125:15** is a valid time that means **125** hours and **15** minutes also **0:96** is a valid entry and it is displayed as: **01:36** that is **1** hour and **36** minutes

Complete the implementation of the Time class with the following mandatory specs:  

```C++
namespace sdds {
   class Time {
      unsigned int m_minutes;
   public:
      Time& setToNow();
      Time(unsigned int minutes = 0);
      std::ostream& write(std::ostream& ostr) const;
      std::istream& read(std::istream& istr);

      Time& operator-=(const Time& D);
      Time operator-(const Time& D)const;
      Time& operator+=(const Time& D);
      Time operator+(const Time& D)const;

      Time& operator=(unsigned int val);
      Time& operator *= (unsigned int val);
      Time& operator /= (unsigned int val);
      Time operator *(unsigned int val)const;
      Time operator /(unsigned int val)const;

      operator unsigned int()const;
      operator int()const;
   };
```
```C++
Time& setToNow();  
```
setToNow, sets the **Time** to the current time using **sdds::getTime()** (available in **utils** module) and then returns the reference of the current object.

> Note that if the **sdds::debug** is set to true, the **getTime()** function will receive the time from the user instead. This will be used for debugging purposes and when submitting your work through the submitter program.

### Time::Time

```C++
Time(unsigned int min = 0); 
```
Constructs the Time by setting the number of minutes held in the object or set the time to zero by default.

### Time::write

```C++
std::ostream& write(std::ostream& ostr) const;
```

Writes the time into a stream in HH:MM format padding the spaces with zero if
the numbers are single digit (examples   03:02, 16:55  234:06 )

### Time::read

```C++
std::istream& read(std::istream& istr);
```

Reads the time from a stream in H:M format. It makes sure that the two integers (hours and minute) are greater than zero and separated by ":", otherwise it will set the **istream** object to a [failure state](#setting-istream-to-a-fail-state). 

This function does not react to any invalid data, instead, it will work exactly how istream works; *It will put the istream in a failure state if anything goes wrong* by following these steps:

- reads the integer for the hours using **istr** and if the value is negative, it sets [the istream object to a failure state](#setting-istream-to-a-fail-state).
- reads one character and makes sure it is **':'**. If it is not **':'**, it will set [the istream object to a failure state](#setting-istream-to-a-fail-state).
- reads the integer for the minutes using **istr** and if the value is negative, it [sets the istream object to a failure state](#setting-istream-to-a-fail-state).

#### setting istream to a fail state
To set the istream to a fail state manually call the following method of istream:

```C++
setstate(ios::failbit);
```

> Note: Do not clear or flush the **istream** object since this method complies with the **istream** standards. The caller of this function may check the state of the **istream** object to make sure that the read was successful if needed.

### Time basic arithmetic operations

All the implemented basic arithmetic operations on **Time** are done exactly as it is defined in math except for the subtraction: 

### Time::operator-=
Design the subtraction in the **Time** as if you are turning a 24-hour clock backwards:

```C++
Time& operator-= (const Time& D);
```
Calculates the time difference between the current time and the incoming argument Time **D** and the returns the reference of the left operand object. Note that the difference can never be a negative value:<br/>
23:00 -= 9:00 will be **14:00**.<br />
18:00 -= 16:00 will be **2:00**.<br />
1:00 -= 22:00 will be **3:00**.  ((**1:00** + 24:00) - **22:00**)<br /> 
Also:<br />
1:00 -= 46:00 will be **3:00**. ((**1:00** + 24:00 + 24:00) - **46:00**)<br /> 
See the illustration below:
![Time](images/time.png)


### Time::operator-

```C++
Time operator-(const Time& D)const;
```
Works exactly like the operator-= but without side-effect. This operator will not modify the left operand and returns a **Time** object that is the result of the calculation.

### Time::operator+=
```C++
Time& operator+=(const Time& D);
```
Add the minute value of the right operand to the value of the left operand and then returns the reference of the left operand.


### Time::operator+
```C++
Time operator+(const Time& D)const;
```
Creates a Time object with the minute value that is the sum of the minute values of the left and right operands and then returns it.


### Time::operator=

```C++
Time& operator=(unsigned int val);
```
Sets the minute value of the left operand to the value of the right operand and then returns the reference of the left operand. 

### Time::operator*=

```C++
Time& operator *= (unsigned int val);
```
Multiplies the minutes' value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and then returns the reference of the left operand. 

### Time::operator*

```C++
Time operator *(unsigned int val)const;
```
Creates a **Time** object with the minutes value being the product of the minutes' value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and returns the object.

### Time::operator/=

```C++
Time& operator /= (unsigned int val);
```
Divides the minutes' value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and then returns the reference of the left operand. 

### Time::operator/

```C++
Time operator /(unsigned int val)const;
```

Creates a **Time** object with the minutes value being the division of the minutes' value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and returns the object.


### Time::operator int

```C++
operator int()const;
```
When the time is cast to an integer, it will return the number of minutes as an integer.

### Time::operator unsigned int

```C++
operator unsigned int()const;
```
When the time is cast to an unsigned integer, it will return the number of minutes.



```C++
operator<<
```
Overload the insertion operator to be able to insert a Time object into an ostream object 
```C++
operator>>
```
Overload the extraction operator to be able to extract data from an istream object into the Time object

### Time unit test
```C++
void timeTester() {
   Time D(1385u), C(65u), E;

# Milestone 2
## Menu Module
Menu class encapsulates a menu and provides selection functionality for the caller program.

```C++
 class Menu{
      char* m_text; // holds the menu content dynamically
      int m_noOfSel;  // holds the number of options displayed in menu content
      void display()const;
   public:
      Menu(const char* MenuContent, int NoOfSelections);
      virtual ~Menu();
      int& operator>>(int& Selection);
      // add safe copying logic
   };
```

```C++
 Menu(const char* MenuContent, int NoOfSelections);
```
Dynamically allocates memory to hold the content pointed by **m_text**. Also keeps the number of Selections in **m_noOfSel**.
```C++
 ~Menu();
```
Deallocates the dynamically allocated memory.
```Text
Copy and assignment
```
Make sure the Menu can be safely copied but **not** be able to be assigned to another Menu object.
```Text
display
```
Displays the Menu content and then in a new line, it displays:

```Text
0- Exit
<NEWLINE>
```
```C++
int& operator>>(int& Selection);
```
The member insertion operator first calls the display function and then receives the user's selection as an integer value using the **getInt()** function in **utils** module. The integer reference **selection** argument is then set to this value and returned.<br />
Make sure that the entered value is validated as an integer and also the value should be between 0 and **m_noOfSel**.<br />
If the above conditions are not met, a proper error message should be displayed and re-entry requested(see below)

Assuming that the menu content is set to:```"Tester Options menu:\n1- Option one\n2- Option two\n3- Option three"``` and the number of selections is set to 3 the **operator>>** should run like this:
```Text
Tester Options menu:
1- Option one
2- Option two
3- Option three
0- Exit
> -1
Invalid option [0 <= value <= 3]: 4
Invalid option [0 <= value <= 3]: 2
```

## Menu Tester program execution sample (menuTester.cpp)
```Text
Tester Options menu:
1- Option one
2- Option two
3- Option three
0- Exit
> -1
Invalid option [0 <= value <= 3]: 4

```

## IOAble interface module

In milestone 1 we have created the utility classes and Time display and calculations.<br />
Now we need to start to create the core classes of the application.  The diagram below displays the core classes of the application and their relationship.

![Classes](images/classes.png)

Create a class called **IOAble**.  This class is an interface and enforces input and output methods to its derived classes.<br />
The IOAble class has only 4 pure virtual functions and a virtual empty destructor.

## Pure Virtual Functions:
### csvWrite
This pure virtual function is for future comma-separated ostream outputs.
It receives a reference of an ostream and returns a reference of an ostream. This function is incapable of changing the current object.  
### csvRead
This pure virtual function is for future comma-separated istream input.
It receives a reference of an istream and returns a reference of an istream.
### write
This pure virtual function is for future ostream outputs.
It receives a reference of an ostream and returns a reference of an ostream. This function is incapable of changing the current object.
### read
This pure virtual function is for future istream inputs.
It receives a reference of istream and returns a reference of an istream.
### virtual destructor
This class also has an empty virtual destructor.

## Insertion and Extraction helper operator overloads.
### operator<<
Overload the insertion operator to be able to insert the information of an IOAble object into ostream using the IOAble::write function.
### operator>>
Overload the extraction operator to be able to extract information from an istream into an IOAble object using the IOAble::read function.

## The IOAble tester program. (IOAbleTester.cpp)
Read and study the tester program and understand how it works.  It is a very good example to show how an interface is used as a base class.  It also can help you in the development of the upcoming milestones.

# Milestone 3

## The Ticket Module (implementation provided)

The Ticket class encapsulates a Ticket to be given to the patients when they arrive. Read the code, understand it, and use the logic and the functionalities throughout the project. 

```C++
#ifndef SDDS_TICKET_H_
#define SDDS_TICKET_H_
#include "Time.h"
#include "IOAble.h"
namespace sdds {
   class Ticket:public IOAble{
      Time m_time;  
      int m_number;
   public:
      Ticket(int number);
      operator Time()const;
      int number()const;
      void resetTime();
      std::ostream& csvWrite(std::ostream& ostr)const;
      std::istream& csvRead(std::istream& istr);
      std::ostream& write(std::ostream& ostr )const;
      std::istream& read(std::istream& istr);
   };
}
#endif // !SDDS_TICKET_H_
```
### Member Variables
#### Time m_time;
The time the Ticket was issued
#### int m_Number;
The ticket number; A sequential integer, starting from one and unique for each lineup.
### Member functions and constructor
#### Ticket(int number);
Constructs a Ticket by setting the **m_number** member variable
#### operator Time()const;
When Ticket is casted to **Time** it will return the **m_time**
#### int number()const;
A query returning the number of the ticket
#### void resetTime();
Sets the Ticket time to the current time.
### Virtual function overrides
#### csvWrite
Inserts comma-separated ticket number and time into ostream.
#### csvRead
Extracts the ticket number and time in a comma-separated format from istream.
#### write
Inserts a ticket into the ostream to be displayed on the console.
#### read
Extracts the ticket information from istream.  This function works the same as csvRead. 

## The Patient Module

Create an abstract IOAble patient class (the patient class is a derived class from IOAble).  The patient class is responsible to encapsulate a general patient arriving at the hospital.  In later designs (MS4) the patient class will be inherited into a COVID test patient and a triage patient.  

The following are the mandatory properties of the patient class.

### Member Variables and Objects
#### the patient name
A character pointer variable to hold the name of the patient in a Cstring dynamically.
#### the OHIP number
An integer to hold the OHIP insurance number (exactly 9 digits) of the patient.
#### the ticket
A **Ticket** object to hold the ticket of the patient for the lineup.
#### the file IO flag
A Boolean flag. This flag will be set to **true** if the patient object is to be written into or read from a **file** (comma separated value), otherwise, this flag will be set to **false** if the patient object is to be written on or read from the **console**.

### Constructor and destructor
A patient can be instantiated using a ticket number (an integer) and a file IO flag (a Boolean).  The ticket number is used to initialize the member [ticket object](#the-ticket). The file IO is used to initialize the member [file IO flag](#the-file-io-flag). 

When a patient has instantiated it, If the file IO flag is not provided the default value **"false"** is passed also if the ticket number is not provided the default value **zero (0)** is passed.

### Copying and assignment.
A patient cannot be copied or assigned to another patient; 

### Destructor
The destructor of the patient will deallocate the dynamically allocated [patient name Cstring](#the-patient-name).

### Member functions
#### Pure Virtual Function type()
Create a pure virtual function called **type** that returns a character and is incapable of modifying the current object.
In future derived objects, this function will return a single character that identifies the type of the patient (COVID test patient or Triage patient).

#### FileIO query and modifier
##### fileIO query
Create a query called fileIO that returns the member [file IO flag](#the-file-io-flag).  This query is incapable of modifying the current object.
##### fileIO modifier
Create a modifier member function called fileIO that receives a Boolean value to set the member [fileIO flag](#the-file-io-flag).

#### operator== overloads
##### character comparison
Overload the operator== to compare the current object with an incoming single character and return true if the single character is the same as the return value of [the pure virtual type member function](#pure-virtual-function-type).  This operator receives a single character and returns true or false and can not modify the current object.
##### comparing to another patient
Overload the operator to compare the current object to another patient and return true if the type of the current patient is the same as the type of the other patient.
This operator receives a constant reference of a patient object, and returns true or false, and can not modify the current object.

#### setArrivalTime function
Sets the time of the ticket of the patient to the current time.
This function neither receives nor returns any value.

#### Time cast operator overload
If the patient is casted to the Time type it should return the time of the ticket.
This cast overload can not modify the current object.

#### number
Create a query function called **number** that returns the number of the ticket.
This function can not modify the current object.

### pure virtual function overwrites.
#### csvWrite
Inserts the following values into the ostream in a comma-separated format.  After the values are inserted it will insert a single "comma", and then call the csvWrite function of the member [ticket object](#the-ticket) and return the ostream.

Here is the sequence of the values inserted into ostream
```Text
returned value of type() function
','
name of the patient
','
OHIP number
','
```
then it will call the csvWrite function of the member [ticket object](#the-ticket).

#### csvRead
The csvRead function extracts all the values in the same order as the csvWrite function, except for the type.<br />
- Start with the extraction with the name of the patient up to the comma (**','**) character and dynamically hold it in "[the patient name pointer](#the-patient-name)", dicarding the comma (**','**) delimiter . *Make sure that [the name pointer](#the-patient-name) is deleted before the allocation to guarantee there is no memory leak.* 
- then extract an integer from istream into the OHIP member variable.
- discard the delimeter 
- Finally, end the extraction by calling the csvRead of the member [ticket object](#the-ticket).
- return the istream reference at the end.

#### write
Inserts the patient information into the ostream to be displayed on the console.
- insert  the member [ticket object](#the-ticket into ostream
- go to newline
- insert the name up to 25 character (ingnore the rest if more that 25 characters)
- insert ```", OHIP: "```
- insert the OHIP number number
- return the ostream

#### read
Extracts the ticket information from the console using istream as follows:
- Prompt: ```"Name: "```
- Extract the name of the patient up to the newline (**'\n'**) character and dynamically hold it in "[the patient name pointer](#the-patient-name)", dicarding the newline(**'\n'**) delimiter . *Make sure that [the name pointer](#the-patient-name) is deleted before the allocation to guarantee there is no memory leak.* 
- Prompt: ```"OHIP: "```
- Extract the 9 digit OHIP number from istream; validate it and make sure it is 9 digits. 
- return the istream reference at the end.

Execution example:  
```Text
Name: John Doe
OHIP: abc
Bad integer value, try again: 100
Invalid OHIP Number, [100000000 <= value <= 999999999]: 123123123

```
and follow the instructions.



# Milestone 4
> Note that you may have to modify or correct some of your implementations done in previous milestones, even though you passed the previous (milestones) testers successfully. This is a natural course of developing an application. There is no need to notify your professor about this unless you would like to get advice on the matter. 

Continue the implementation of the Pre-triage application by implementing the COVID patient and the triage patient modules. 

## The CovidPatient module
This module has one integer global variable called **nextCovidTicket** that is initialized to **one**.  This global variable will be used to determine what is the ticket number of the next COVID test Patient.  Each time a new **CovidPatient** object is created the value of the **nextCovidTicket** will be increased by **one**.  The scope of the global **nextCovidTicket** variable is only the **CovidPatient** module to make sure that the ticket numbers of Covid patients are kept separate from the Triage patients.

The **CovidPatient** class is publicly derived from the **Patient** class. The **CovidPatient** class does not add any member variables or properties to the **Patient** module.

The **CovidPatient** class has one **default constructor**, implements the pure virtual **type()** function and re-implements the two **read** functions and the **write** fucniton of the base class **Patient** as follows:

### Default Constructor
Sets the Ticket number to the current global value and then increases the global value by one.
#### implementation
The default constructor passes the **nextCovidTicket** global variable to the **constructor** of the base class **Patient** and then it will increase the value of **nextCovidTicket** global variable by **one**.

### The type() virtual function
Identifies the Patient object as a Covid patient by returning the letter **C**.
#### implementation
This function only returns the character **'C'**;

### csvRead virtual function override
Reads a comma-separated record of a Patient and sets the global ticket number to the next number after the Patient's ticket number.
#### implementation
First this function will call the **csvRead** function of the base class **Patient**, afterwards it will set the **nextCovidTicket** global variable to the return value of the **number()** function of the **Patient** class plus **one**. 
Then it will ignore the terminating **'\n'** character.
Finally, it will return the istream reference.

### write virtual function override.
Based on the return value of the **fileIO** method it will either write the patient in a comma-separated format or a descriptive format for screen or ticket. 
#### implementation
If the **fileIO** member function returns **true**, it will call the **csvWrite** function of the base class, otherwise it will first insert **"COVID TEST"** into the **ostream** object and goes to **newline**. Then it will call the **write()** function of the base class and then goes to **newline**.

Then it will end the function by returning the **ostream** reference.

### read virtual function override. 
Based on the return value of the **fileIO** method it will either read the patient in a comma-separated format from istream or perform a fool-proof entry from the console.
#### implementation
If the **fileIO** member function returns true it will call the **csvRead** function, otherwise, it will call the read function of the base class.

Then it will end the function by returning the **istream** reference.

### Destructor
This class does not need a destructor.

```

## The TriagePatient Module
This module has one integer global variable called **nextTriageTicket** that is initialized to **one**.  This global variable will be used to determine what is the ticket number of the next triage Patient.  Each time a new **TriagePatient** is created the value of the **nextTriageTicket** will be increased by **one**.  The scope of the global **nextTriageTicket** variable is only the TriagePatient module.

The **TriagePatient** class is publicly derived from the **Patient** class. The **TriagePatient** class adds only one character pointer member variable to the **Patient** module to dynamically hold the symptoms of the arriving patient for the triage centre.

The **TriagePatient** class has one **default constructor**, implements the pure virtual **type()** function and re-implements the four **read and write** functions of the base class **Patient**.  It also has a destructor to make sure the dynamically allocated memory by the symptoms character array is deleted.

### Symptoms character pointer member variable
Create a character pointer member variable to point to a dynamically allocated Cstring holding the list of the symptoms of the TriagePatient.


### Default Constructor
Initializes the symptoms character pointer to null and then sets the Triage Ticket number to the current global value and then increases the global value by one.

#### implementation
The default constructor initializes the character pointer member variable to null and then passes the **nextTriageTicket** global variable to the **constructor** of the base class **Patient** and then it will increase the value of **nextTriageTicket** global variable by **one**.

### the type() virtual function
Identifies the Patient object as a Triage patient by returning the letter **T**.
#### implementation
This function only returns the character **'T'**;

### csvWrite virtual function override.
Adds the symptoms to the comma-separated values of the patient. 
#### implementation
This function calls the **csvWrite** function of the base class **Patient** then inserts a comma (',') character into the ostream object and then the symptoms of the patient. Finally, it returns the **ostream** reference.

### the csvRead virtual function override 
Reads a comma-separated record of a triage Patient and sets the global ticket number to the next number after the Patient's ticket number.
#### implementation
csvRead reads the TriagePatient's comma-separated information as follows:
- Deletes the memory pointed by the [symptoms member variable](#symptoms-character-pointer-member-variable)
- Calls the **csvRead** function of the base class.
- Ignores a character (comma).
- Dynamically reads a Cstring from the istream object up to **'\n'**, then extracts the **'\n'** from the istream and stores the address in the [symptoms member variable](#symptoms-character-pointer-member-variable);
- sets the **nextTriageTicket** global variable to the return value of the number() member function of the Patient class plus one.
- returns the istream reference.

### write virtual function override.
Based on the return value of the **fileIO** method it will either write the patient in a comma-separated format or a descriptive format for screen or ticket. 
#### implementation
If the **fileIO** member function returns **true**, it will call **csvWrite** function. otherwise, it will write the TriagePatient as follows:  
- Inserts **"TRIAGE"** into the **ostream** object.
- Goes to **newline**.  
- It will call the **write()** function of the base class **Patient**.
- Goes to **newline**. 
- Inserts **"Symptoms: "** into the ostream object.
- Inserts the symptoms member variable into the ostream object.
- Goes to newline.

The function ends by returning the **ostream** reference.

### read virtual function override. 
If the **fileIO** member function returns true it will call the **csvRead** function, 
otherwise, it will do the following:
- Deletes the memory pointed by the [symptoms member variable](#symptoms-character-pointer-member-variable)
- Calls the **Read** function of the base class **Patient**.
- prompts:  **"Symptoms: "**
-Dynamically reads a Cstring from the istream object up to **'\n'**, then extracts the **'\n'** from the istream and stores the address in the [symptoms member variable](#symptoms-character-pointer-member-variable)

The function ends by returning the **istream** reference.

### Destructor
Deletes the memory pointed by the [symptoms member variable](#symptoms-character-pointer-member-variable)

Upload your source code and the tester program to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler as shown before and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/m4
replace ?? with yoru subject code (44 or 00)
```
and follow the instructions.


# Milestone 5

Before starting your last stage of the project implementation, add the following template to **uitls.h**

```C++
   template <typename type>
   void removeDynamicElement(type* array[], int index, int& size) {
      delete array[index];
      for (int j = index; j < size; j++) {
         array[j] = array[j + 1];
      }
      size--;
   }
```
This template will be used to remove a Patient from the lineup when admitted.

## PreTriage Module

To complete the implementation of the final project, implement a module called Pre-Triage.  This module creates a lineup of patients and issues tickets for them as they arrive at the hospital.  Each patient in the lineup will be either a COVID Patient or a Triage Patient and will receive a ticket with a number that will be called when they are being admitted to either the COVID test centre or Triage Centre.

### Overview of The Triage Module execution

The module gets instantiated by loading the data file holding the patients' records that are already in the lineup. This data file is created by the PreTriage Module at exit time. This makes this module a stateful module, which means when the module exits, it saves all the patients' information into a data file so later, it can restart the application in the same state of the last execution (by loading the data file).

If the data file does not exist or it is not readable, the module assumes that this is the first time it is being executed; and no patients are in the lineup.

After loading the data, the result of the loading is reported and then the main menu of the application is displayed. See below:

If there is no data file or a data file with no Patient records:
```text
Loading data...
No data or bad data file!

General Hospital Pre-Triage Application
1- Register
2- Admit
0- Exit
>
```
If there is a data file with patient lineup records:
```text
Loading data...
16 Records imported...

General Hospital Pre-Triage Application
1- Register
2- Admit
0- Exit
>
```
The user can then select either register or admit.

> **Register**: This option is selected when a patient arrives at the hospital. Afterwards, the program will display another menu to select the type of Patient and receives the patient's information. The Patient is then added to the lineup and a ticket is printed. 

> **Admit**: This option is selected when either the COVID or Triage centre is ready to accept the next patient. Afterwards, the program will display another menu to select the type of Patient and shows the information of the next patient in line. 

> **Exit**: When this option is selected, the program exits saving the information of the patients in the lineup.  

The program will load this data file the next time it starts. See below:

## PreTriage Implementation

Review the PreTriage class and implement the member functions as guided below:

```C++
namespace sdds {
   const int maxNoOfPatients = 100;
   class PreTriage {
      Time 
         m_averCovidWait, 
         m_averTriageWait;
      Patient* m_lineup[maxNoOfPatients]{};
      char* m_dataFilename = nullptr;
      int m_lineupSize = 0;
      Menu 
         m_appMenu, 
         m_pMenu;
      void reg();
      void admit();
      const Time getWaitTime(const Patient& p)const;
      void setAverageWaitTime(const Patient& p);
      void removePatientFromLineup(int index);
      int indexOfFirstInLine(char type) const;
      void load();
   public:
      PreTriage(const char* dataFilename);
      ~PreTriage();
      void run(void);
   };
```
### Member Variables and Objects
#### maxNoOfPatients
A constant value to set the maximum number of patients in the lineup (Covid and Triage)
#### m_averCovidWait and m_averTriageWait
Time objects to hold the average wait time for COVID test and Triage per patient
#### m_lineup
An array of Patient pointers to hold COVID and Triage Patient lineups dynamically
#### m_dataFilename
A character pointer to hold the name of the data file dynamically
#### m_lineupSize
Number of Patients in the lineup.
#### m_appMenu
Menu object to hold the main menu.
#### m_pMenu
Menu object to hold the COVID/Triage patient selection.
### Member functions, Constructor and Destructor
#### PreTriage Constructor
PreTriage is constructed using a Cstring for a file name that will be used as the data file for the module. This name will be kept dynamically in the m_dataFilename member variable.

The constructor will initialize the the following objects:  
- m_appMenu will be initialized by:<br />
`"General Hospital Pre-Triage Application\n1- Register\n2- Admit"` and `2`
- m_pMenu will be initialized by: <br />
`"Select Type of Admittance:\n1- Covid Test\n2- Triage"` and `2`
- m_averCovidWait will be initialized to 15
- m_averTriageWait will be initialized to 5

> Note: You can initialize member variables and member objects the same way the Base constructor is invoked for initialization in inheritance. See the following example:

```C++
    class Foo{
       int m_value;
       char m_charval[20]{};  
    public: 
       Foo(int v, const char* cv):m_value(v){ // <<-- here m_value is being initialized by v
          strcpy(m_charval, cv);  
       }
    }
    class Faa{
       Foo m_obj;
    public:
       Faa(int v, const char* cv):m_obj(v, cv){ // <<-- here m_obj is being initialized by v and cv
          //....
       }
    }
```

After all these, the **load()** member function will be called to import the Patient records from the data file. (see load function)
#### PreTriage Destructor
- The data file is opened for output, overwriting the content of the file if it already exists.
- The average COVID wait time and the average Triage wait time is written in the first line of the file, comma-separated and also on the screen as follows:  
```text
Saving Average Wait Times,
   COVID Test: H:M
   Triage: H:M
```
- All the patients are written into the file, comma-separated in individual lines.
- Simultaneously the patient records are printed on the screen (comma separated) with a row number. as follows: 
```text
row#- comma separated patient information
```
Example
```text
5- C,Eddie,547723561,21,01:42
6- T,Edna Krabappel,435676529,14,01:50,Muscle tension-Nausea-Photosensitivity
```
- All the Patients pointed by the elements of the m_lineup array are deleted.
- data file name is deleted. 
- the confirmation massage `"done!"` is printed on the screen at the end.

#### getWaitTime (private)
Receives a constant Patient Reference and returns the total estimated wait time for that type of Patient (COVID or Triage)

- Find the number of Patients matching the type of the Patient Reference in the lineup. 
> one way to do this is to loop through the m_lineup array and count the patients matching the Patient Reference
- Return the product of estimated wait time by the number of patients.

#### setAverageWaitTime (private)
Receives the reference of the admitting patient and adjusts the average wait time of that type of patient base on the admittance time of the patient.

Modify and set the value of the average wait time (m_averCovidWait or m_averTriageWait) of the patient using the following formula:  
```text
CT: Current Time
PTT: Patient's Ticket Time
AWT: Average Wait Time (Covid or Triage)
PTN: Patient's Ticket Number
AWT = ((CT - PTT) + (AWT * (PTN - 1))) / PTN
```
#### removePatientFromLineup (private)
Using the **removeDynamicElement** template in **utils.h** removes a Patient form the line up at a specific index and also removes it from memory.

#### indexOfFirstInLine
Finds the index of the first patient in line which matches the **type** argument

> Hint: Loop from the beginning of the **m_lineup** array of pointers and compare the patient with the **type** argument. If a match is found, return the index of the loop and terminate the function.

If no match is found return -1.

#### load (private)
Loads the average wait times and the patient records from the data file and stores them in the m_lineup array.
- print `"Loading data..."`, goto newline
- read the covid average wait time from the data file
- ignore the comma
- read the triage average wait time from the data file
- ignore the newline
- pseudo-code:
```text
have a patient-pointer
loop from 0 to the maximum number of patients and stop if reading fails
    read the first character and ignore the comma
    if the character is 'C'
       in the patient-pointer instantiate a Covid Patient
    otherwise, if the character is 'T'
       in the patient-pointer instantiate a Triage Patient
    endif
    If Instantiation happened
       Set the patient to file IO
       Read the patient from the file
       Set the Patient not to do file IO
       copy the patient pointer to the lineup array of pointers
       increase the lineup size
    end if
end loop
```
- At the end print these messages and go to newline:
- if there is still records left in the file, print the following warning:  
'"Warning: number of records exceeded"' and then print the maximum number of records, example:
```text
Warning: number of records exceeded 100
```
- if no records were read print `"No data or bad data file!"` otherwise, print `"###  Records imported..."` (### is replaced with the number of records read)

- Examples:
```text
Loading data...
Warning: number of records exceeded 100
100 Records imported...
```
```text
Loading data...
16 Records imported...
```
```text
Loading data...
No data or bad data file!
```

#### reg (private)
Registers a new patient

- if lineup size has reached the maximum number of patient, it will print `"Line up full!"`, goes to new line and terminates the function
- displays the **m_pMenu** and receives the selection
- if the selection is 1, in the next available lineup pointer instantiate a CovidPatient
- if the selection is 2, in the next available lineup pointer instantiate a TriagePatient
- if the selection is 0, terminate the function
- set the patient's arrival time 
- print: `"Please enter patient information: "`
- (you might need to set the patient not to do File IO)
- extract the patient from cin
- go to newline
- print: `"******************************************"`
- go to newline
- insert the patient into cout
- print: `"Estimated Wait Time: "`
- print the return value of **getWaitTime** for the patient.
- go to newline
- print: `"******************************************"`
- go to newline twice

#### admit (private)
Calls the next patient in line to be admitted to the COVID test centre or Triage centre

- displays the **m_pMenu** and receives the selection to determine the type of the patient to admit.
- if selection is 1, the type is 'C'
- if selection is 2, the type is 'T'
- if selection is 0, terminate the function
- find the index of the next patient in the line for the type (use member the member function)
- if no patient is found, terminate the function
- go to newline
- print: `"******************************************"`
- go to newline
- set the patient not to do File IO
- print: `"Calling for "`
- insert the patient into cout
- print: `"******************************************"`
- go to newline twice
- set Average Wait Time for the patient
- remove the patient from the lineup.

#### run (public)
- display m_appMenu and get the selection
- if selection is 0, quit the function
- if selection is 1 call the **reg** function
- if selection is 2 call the **admit** function
- repeat


## The tester programs and data files

There are several tester programs for different scenarios:

### fp1Tester.cpp

The tester program for execution with a new (non-existent) data file

### fp2Tester.cpp

The tester program for a small data file (only 16 records)

### fp3Tester.cpp

The tester program for a big data file (103 records)

## fpTester.cpp 

The fpTester program will be copied from the professor's directory to yours and will combine all three testers.

The execution samples will be provided by Monday, Dec 30th.

## MS5 Submission and the due date
Milestone 5 is due on Sunday, Apr 11th, 23:59 for a full mark. 

To see the detailed submission dates and corresponding marks issue the submit comment using ```-due``` option:
```shell
~porfname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/fp -due
OR
~porfname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/open -due

replace ?? with your subject code (44 or 00)
```

### Milestone submission marks
25% mark for milestones if they are submitted in the past 5 weeks and not all at once at the end. (no hard due date for ms1 to ms4; OK if submissions are done regularly in the past four weeks)

### Submitting with non-exact output (10% penalty)
If your submission does not match the output exactly and is different with number of spaces or newlines, you can submit your work using the following options:  
```shell
~porfname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/fp -skip_spaces 
or
~porfname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/fp -skip_blank_lines
or both
~porfname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/fp -skip_blank_lines -skip_spaces

replace ?? with your subject code (44 or 00)

```

### Open submission (Maximum 60% for incomplete work)

This submission will not check the output. But the program must compile and run successfully and must be functional.
#### NOTE:
- Submission is rejected if milestones 1 to 4 are not submitted regularly (submissions do not have to match the due-dates exactly)
- The mark is based on the professor’s discretion and a maximum 60% is not a guaranty.
- You must mention in your reflect.txt why you chose open submission.
- You may use open submission after you have done your full submission if you have added additional features and want to demonstrate them for extra marks; make sure to discuss this with your professor and have the details in your reflection submission.

## Reflection

Create a file named `reflect.txt` and reflect on the Project and your overall experience in OOP244 subject in this semester. Point out issues that was challenging and what you would like to see improved.

**This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time and the result is suggested to be at least 200 words in length.**

### Submission 

Upload your source code and the tester programs to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler as shown above and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):

#### Normal submission
```shell
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/fp
replace ?? with your subject code (44 or 00)
```
#### Open submission
```shell
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/open
replace ?? with your subject code (44 or 00)
```
and follow the instructions.

#### Test Data
Please enter the following data when submitting your code. The main tester (fpTester.cpp) calls fp1Tester, then fp3Tester and finally fp2Tester. These are the same data used in the sample execution of the three tester programs.
##### fp1Test:
